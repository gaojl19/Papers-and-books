- Today I read 4 papers: Cliport,

#### Cliport
- This paper proposed a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter.
    - Solves language-specified tabletop tasks from packingunseen objects to folding cloths


## 2022.2.20
- Today I read a paper Learning universal policies via text-to-video generation by bkl, this paper proposed to use text-to-video generation to solve sequential manipulation tasks, as these large models pretrained on data available on the Internet can provide better generalization properties.
    - The first problem is combinatorial generalization
        - Env: Painting Factory, same as the PDSketch paper by Mao at MIT
    - The second problem is multi-task generalization
        - Env: a suite of language guided manipulation tasks, same as CLIPort
    - The third problem is real-robot manipulation
        - Env: Bridge dataset
